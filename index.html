      <p>My name is Tyler Ward, I'm a nerdy dad who plays Dungeons and Dragons and has a collegiate background in Animal Science
        and Entomology. I've worked a lot of jobs since graduating college, none of which were in my fields but it's taught me
        a lot about working with people and finding out where my interests lie. Currently I'm employed at a game/hobby retail store in Lawrence, KS and while I enjoy my job, coworkers, and clientele, 4
        I wanted more for myself and more time with my young family. 
      </p>
      <p>I've always had a love of computers having grown up with them from starting with Windows 3.1 and got to watch the internet develop from the AOL disk days onward.
        Recently I decided to take the plunge into web development by enrolling in a coding bootcamp at the University of Kansas.
        It has definitely been one of the more difficult undertakings in my life but very rewarding and enlightening to learn how
        all the pieces fit together to make a functioning and aesthetically pleasing website. 
      </p>
      <p>I want to provide my clients with just that, websites that are functional, easy to navigate, look good, and keep their clientele coming back and happy.
        So if you are in the market for a new website, application, or looking to bring another web developer onto your team, please
      reach out to me. You can contact me via the contact link on the top right and fill out the simple form.</p>
